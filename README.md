videoconv
=========

This tool uses FFmpeg to convert videos to format that has good quality, doesn't take too much disk space, and is
supported by most of the operating systems and applications.

The tool also focuses on simplicity. Currently there are only two types of arguments:

1. One or more input files
2. A single output file

Here is an example how to use the tool:

```
./videoconv.py input_video1.avi input_video2.avi output_video.mp4
```
